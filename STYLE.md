STYLE: Project header and file-formatting rules (authoritative)

This file contains the exact header template and tone rules that MUST be followed for every file created or edited in this repository. When I create or modify files for you, I will use this template verbatim unless you explicitly request a different metadata value.

1) Required file-level header (metadata)
- Every file (source and header) must begin with a file-level header comment block containing these metadata fields in this exact order:
  - Name: Anthony Candelas
  - Email: tsallinger2@unl.edu
  - Date: DDMMMyyyy (example: 03NOV2025 — use uppercase 3-letter month)
  - Lab/Task: (e.g., Hack09 - String Utilities)

2) Description placement and rules
- For header files (e.g., `*.h`, Java interfaces) include a `Description:` section immediately after the metadata lines inside the same header block.
- For non-header source files (e.g., `*.c`, `*.java`) include the same metadata header block; the `Description:` line may be a single brief sentence unless you instruct otherwise.
- Tone and wording rules for `Description:`:
  - Neutral, concise, and factual (1–3 sentences). Do NOT use phrases such as "human-friendly", "AI-generated", "generated by", "I", or other meta statements about authorship or generation.
  - Use the exact labels `Description:` and `NOTE:` where needed. Do not deviate from label casing or punctuation.

2.a) Cross-language doc-style comment requirement
- For any language used in this repository that supports doc-style or block comments (for example: Java, C, C++, JavaScript, Go, Rust, etc.), prefer doc-style/block comments for file-level headers and short explanatory comments above functions or types.
- Single-line `//` comments are acceptable for short inline notes inside method bodies, but file headers and public API documentation must use block/doc-style comments so the header template is consistently parseable and visible to graders and tooling.
- When creating new files in any supported language, apply the same metadata header (Name, Email, Date, Lab/Task, Description, NOTE) inside that language's block-comment syntax. Example mappings:
  - Java/C/C++/JavaScript: use /* ... */ for the file header.
  - Python: use a top-of-file triple-quoted string if preferred (or a block of '#' comments following the same label order).
  - Rust/Go: use the language's block comment style or a leading doc comment where appropriate.


3) What to document in the header (when relevant)
- Short statement of purpose (Description).
- Ownership/return semantics for any allocated return values (e.g., "Returns malloc'd memory; caller must free").
- Brief note of error behavior (e.g., "On NULL input returns NULL") where helpful.

4) Minimal public API contract
- For C headers: include prototypes with concise `@param` / `@return` style comments directly in the header. Example style:
  /*
   * /* Name: function_name */
   * /* Description: what it does */
   * /* Params: */
   * /*   - param: description */
   * /* Returns: */
   */

5) Formatting and small rules
- Keep existing project style (indentation and naming). Prefer lower_case_with_underscores for filenames and public C identifiers.
- Avoid filler comments. Place short, functional comments above the block or function they describe.

6) Date format and metadata examples
- Date must use the DDMMMyyyy form exactly, e.g. `03NOV2025`.
- Example header (this exact label order is required):

/*
 * Name: Anthony Candelas
 * Email: tsallinger2@unl.edu
 * Date: 03NOV2025
 * Lab/Task: Hack09 - String Utilities
 *
 * Description:
 * Implements string utilities used in Hack09. Functions that return
 * allocated memory document ownership in the header; callers must free
 * those allocations.
 *
 * NOTE: Copy-returning functions allocate with malloc; caller is
 * responsible for free().
 */

7) Enforcement and workflow
- This `STYLE.md` is the authoritative template. Before creating or editing files, reference `STYLE.md` and apply its header template exactly. If you want a different `Name`, `Email`, `Date`, or `Lab/Task` for a particular file, state it explicitly in your request.
- Small deviations (e.g., additional NOTE lines) are allowed so long as required metadata order and label names are preserved.

8) Examples and edge-cases to call out
- Null/invalid inputs: document `NULL` handling in the header.
- Memory ownership: always document whether a function returns malloc'd memory.
- Test files: include metadata header and a `Description:` that explains what the test verifies; tests should free allocated memory and preferably exit non-zero on automated failures if requested.

9) Change log
- If you update `STYLE.md`, add a short bullet with the date and summary of the change at the bottom.
